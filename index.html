                      <p>For new students, this important step helps you officially become part of the University of Wolverhampton; after you complete online enrolment, you will be able to access your course timetable and other University systems. This process is vital in order to maintain an organised and smooth-running institution, but it can be daunting for new starters who are not used to university bureaucracy. Do not worry – here is a quick guide on how to get through it!<br>
The first thing you'll need when starting university is your student ID card. Your faculty will let you know where to pick it up. You'll need to have this card on hand whenever you want to borrow books from the library or use other university services.

Some universities offer their own health insurance plans, so it's worth checking if your institution provides this service. If not, there are private health insurance options available that cater specifically to international students. It's important to research and purchase a plan before arriving in the UK to ensure you're covered from day one.</p>

              <h3>Living in Wolverhampton</h3>
              <p>Located in the West Midlands, Wolverhampton is a mid-sized city with a population of about 260,000 individuals. Despite its relatively smaller size, Wolverhampton is famous for its long and rich heritage as a commercial and manufacturing powerhouse (with engineering remaining key to the city’s economy). With a local history dating back to the Middle Ages, the city beautifully interweaves its centuries-old architectural treasures with modern redevelopment efforts, seamlessly blending past and present from the city centre to the suburbs. <br>
       
             Wolverhampton’s prime central UK location makes it a great residential area even for those working outside the city. With its fast and convenient transport links, Wolverhampton is only minutes away from Birmingham and about an hour’s journey from Manchester.  </p>
