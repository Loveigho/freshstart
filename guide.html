                      <p>For new students, this important step helps you officially become part of the University of Wolverhampton; after you complete online enrolment, you will be able to access your course timetable and other University systems. This process is vital in order to maintain an organised and smooth-running institution, but it can be daunting for new starters who are not used to university bureaucracy. Do not worry – here is a quick guide on how to get through it!<br>
The first thing you'll need when starting university is your student ID card. Your faculty will let you know where to pick it up. You'll need to have this card on hand whenever you want to borrow books from the library or use other university services.

You should receive a personalized link for the right to study check, which will be emailed to you before you complete online enrolment. If you are a student visa holder, you cannot complete the right to study check until you have arrived in the UK.</p>

                      <p>In addition to registering with a local GP, international students should also make sure they have health insurance that covers them during their stay in the UK. Some universities offer their own health insurance plans, so it's worth checking if your institution provides this service. If not, there are private health insurance options available that cater specifically to international students. It's important to research and purchase a plan before arriving in the UK to ensure you're covered from day one.</p>
